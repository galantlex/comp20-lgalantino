# README for annotation lab, completed by Lexi Galantino

1. To the best of my knowledge, all aspects have been correctly implemented.
2. I did not specifically collaborate with anyone for this assignment.
3. This assignment took me about 2 hours total. In fairness, at least
one hour of that was trying to get the timing right. That was hard.
